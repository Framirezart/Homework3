<h1>FRamirezArt </h1>

<p>For my final project in will design a website that will display my work of arts, where I can sell work and increase the amount of people to see my work. </p>

<p>Three types of people that might visit my website might be: </p>

<li>
    <ol>People looking to buy art for their home </ol>
    <p> If i am going to display art work, there might be a chance that someone will be instersted to have an art peice for themselves or for their home.
    they might visit the website to find a work of art they would want to hang in their hallways or rooms.
   </p>
    <ol>People looking for artist to join a art gallery show</ol>
    <p>They will visit the website to view my work to see if it is something they would want me to display at a art show.
    </p>
    <ol> People who want to work together on a project </ol>
    <p>They might want to visit the website to see that kind of art i am instersted in. they might also might want to see what I or need improvement in.
     </p>
</li>

<p>Three websites that reflect what i would like to create are:</p>
  <ol> <a href="https://teddyfresh.com/"> The Teddy Fresh website </a> </ol>
    <ol> <a href="https://www.moma.org/"> The MOMA website </a></ol>
      
<p> From the MOMA page, i really like how the nav bar moves up and down while you scroll making it easy for yoyu won't have to scroll all the way back up to the top of the screen. The Teddy Fresh website i really like when you hover above an item, the image changes to another view of the item and gives you the option to quick view the item. I also enjoyed the title of the item under the image of the item and under the title was the pricing in red.</p>
